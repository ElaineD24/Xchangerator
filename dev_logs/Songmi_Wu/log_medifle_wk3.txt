Team involvement
- I explained the pull request #4 about the working backend architecture
- we researched the a credential issue that Xcode did not allow other team members computers building the same iOS project on a real device.
  - found a solution using project creator's credential: Certificate(.p12) and Provisioning Profile(.mobileprovision)


Individual work (Backend)
- support Cron job: every 1 hr
- fix race condition in Cron job when running multiple Node processes
- support Redis in-memory cache for one or multiple Node processes to achieve fast and scalable incoming query responses
- switch data API to `openexchangerates.org` after finishing server test
